Supervised machine learning is a general term for machine learning algorithms in which the training data includes both feature values and known label values. Supervised machine learning is used to train models by determining a relationship between the features and labels in past observations, so that unknown labels can be predicted for features in future cases

Regression is a form of supervised machine learning in which the label predicted by the model is a numeric value.
